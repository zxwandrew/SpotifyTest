# SpotifyTest
This is intended to be a proof of concept using Meteor.js to create a single page application.
This application will allow a user to login to Spotify and obtain all their playlists and tracks.

The ultimate goal of this project is to export playlist to various other music streaming providers.

The project certainly does not look pretty at this moment. A new project will be started soon to replace this one.
